# NMEA0183 $PPITA Sentence for Autopilot Status

Pitufinoâ€™s firmware version V1.5.3 introduced the (proprietary) NMEA0183 sentence $PPITA to transmit autopilot status (mode, locked heading and locked wind angle). This sentence can be used (ideally together with the standard sentences $HDG for compass heading and $RSA for rudder angle) to implement an autopilot display. Note, this sentence is **not** meant for controlling an autopilot.
